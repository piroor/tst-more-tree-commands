## Author's comment from @piroor

I'm finding successor developers of the "TST More Tree Commands" project. I'm ready to transfer the ownership of this project to successors.

I generally use TST without manual manipulation modifying the tree structure, instead I use TST mainly with automatically constructed tree.
"Indent", "outdent", and more other tree manipulation commands are non-critical for my usecase, and I'm negative about adding more new tree manipulation commands to TST itself.
This is the reason why I decided to separate these features from TST to a helper addon.

From the same reason, sorry but I have less motivation to develop and maintain this project.
I believe that this project should be owned by someone who really want to use it.
If you are interested to take the ownership of this project, please contact me via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/piroor/tst-more-tree-commands/issues) or [email](mailto:piro.outsider.reflex@gmail.com).
